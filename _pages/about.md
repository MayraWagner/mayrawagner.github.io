My name is Mayra Wagner, and I am currently a pre-doctoral researcher for Prof. Mar Reguant at the Barcelona School of Economics and a research assistant at STICERD for Amen Jalal and Veronica Salazar Restrepo.

I am interested in energy economics, the economics of deforestation, and spatial economics. I am currently applying for a PhD Economics program starting in 2025.
